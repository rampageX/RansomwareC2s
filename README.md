# RansomwareC2s
I begin to collect the C2 Servers address because some of my friends infected by some ransomwares last week. Sometimes, block those C2 Servers may keep files safe. I wish my collecting would helpful to people.

If you have new C2 servers to report, please click "Issues" above, and submit there, THANKS!

Wish you have a nice day.
